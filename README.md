# TinyAGI AOP - Agent Oriented Programming Experiment

TinyAGI AOP is a small experimental repository that aims to showcase some basic concepts behind Agent Oriented Programming (AOP), a paradigm that is somewhat synonuymous to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) but at a much higher level of abstraction.

While OOP will remain and still serve as one of the key programming models, AOP will aim to operate on a semantically higher level.

With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and GPT, it opens up a far greater opportunity for creating AOP-based systems. LLM/GPT based systems will, however, require a change in thinking about solutions to a problem space.
